# Broforce-Autosplitter
As the Title says this is an Autosplitter for speedrunning Broforce.
"broforce_New_Patch.asl" is the finished autosplitter.
"Broforce_beta.CT" is a cheat engine file with all the pointers I use (and some extra ones).
This is useful if the Autosplitter does't work as intendet for you. You can use it to see which Pointers don't work.
