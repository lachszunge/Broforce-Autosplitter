# Broforce-Autosplitter
As the Title says this is an Autosplitter for speedrunning Broforce. <br/>
"broforce_New_Patch.asl" is the finished autosplitter. <br/>
"Broforce_beta.CT" is a cheat engine file with all the pointers I use (and some extra ones). <br/>
This is useful if the Autosplitter does't work as intendet for you. You can use it to see which Pointers don't work. <br/>

"Expendabros.asl" is an Autosplitter for the free promotional game Expendabros. <br/>
The Autosplitter is not yet finished and I don't know if it ever will be.
